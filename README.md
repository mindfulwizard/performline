My solution to the following challenge:

Write a program that takes these two files as input:

names.txt - Contains a list of names, one name per line.
list.txt - Contains a list of words, some are names, one per line.
Then prints (to stdout) the line numbers and instance in list.txt where names from names.txt are found.

For example, if list.txt contains three instances of the name 'james' it would output something like:
james: 51, 1450, 14123
